* Description of Topic

** What is the project?
The project is aiming to use computational methods to answer biologically significant
 questions on wheat grain morphology and domestication using \textmu{CT} images.

\vspace{1cm}

To do this, I will be using:

- Computer vision on 3D image sets
- Statistical analysis and data science
- Scientific theory to create reproducible results



** Research Question:
*** Is it possible to use \textmu{CT} imaging to answer questions about Wheat domestication?
/I hope so!/
*** Null-Hypothesis
- $H_0=$ Domestication has no effect on the morphometric properties of wheat
- $H_0=$ Ploidy has no effect on the morphometric properties of wheat
- $H_0=$ There is no difference in hulled and non-hulled genotypes

/*Hulling is a trait associated with domestication/


* Materials and Image Capture Setup

** Materials (Plant)
*** Wheat information						      :BMCOL:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :BEAMER_col: 0.45
   :END:

I have a wide range of Wheat genotypes, these are:
- Ranged between diploid, tetraploid and hexiploid
- 12 total genotypes
- Divided between domestication status

*** Image							      :BMCOL:

   :BEAMER_col: 0.3
   :END:
    #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 3cm
    #+CAPTION: A Primitive Wheat Spike
    [[./images/wheatspike.png]]

** Methods (Image Generation)

*** Capture Methods
In order to generate this data  a \textmu{CT}100 scanner (ScancoMedical, Switzerland) was used
Each spike was:
- ~1000 slices (51 slices per stack),
- 125 projections/180\textdegree{} were taken and a
- binning of 6 was used.
- Output images are a 0.2 megapixel (512 x 512) resolution (68.8 \textmu{}/pixel)



* Completed Work
** Data Gathering
*** MATLAB Software
Data has been extracted from the \textmu{CT} images using a method I previously developed at
IBERS cite:Hughes2017. A lot of additions and novel augmentations have been added in order to work
with the range of Wheat genotypes.

\vspace{0.5cm}

- This is done via separating non-grain from grain ROIs in the image data
- Measurements are taken on a per grain level
- Measurements are in mm, mm^2 and mm^3 based on type
- Data is exported as CSV files

** Improved Watershedding Algorithm

*** Algorithm
#+NAME: eqn:qe
\begin{equation}
\left | x_1 - x_2 \right | + (\sqrt{2}-1), \left | x_1 - x_2 \right | >\left | y_1 - y_2 \right | (\sqrt{2}-1) \left | x_1 - x_2 \right |,\textup{otherwise}
\end{equation}


*** Visual Example

* Additional Aims


** Additional Aims
*** Not yet started, but would like to implement by end of project
- Automate error finding and identification
- Visually Display Errors in Data
- Write testing suite for software

*** Ideas for future work
- Test software library on other datasets
- Grow more plants and create more replicates for more robust study
